STANDUP 01 - 2/10/2023 Team Axolotl



General Update and Intro
========================

All team members are in a whatsapp group for discussion, and Vidhya and Nick
are our team leaders. Created a github repo for the group at 
https://github.com/verrochi92/axolotl. Had some discussion on technologies we
would use, but we need to dig into the original project and libraries it used 
bit. We have decided to go with an MVC architecture but we have to finalize
what technologies we will use.


Draft of Requirements
=====================

MAIN: We will expand upon Allen Dai's Axolotl project and add the following
new features, which will help the McCusker lab's study of Axolotl regeneration:

* Allow measurements to be taken using the viewer
* Allow for annotation on the images
* Store the measurements
* Use colored dots to mark where measurements are being taken
* Have a way to display coordinates 
* Reset feature to clear measurements taken

For technologies, we propose:
* Javascript, HTML, and CSS as it will be a web-based application
* OpenSeaDragon to view images in high resolution
* Cornerstone medical imaging tools


Questions / Problems / What We Need
===================================

* We need to come to a final decision on a tech stack
* We need to decide how we are going to store data
* We need some image sets to work with


List of Working Packages
========================

* Read documentation on OpenSeaDragon and Cornerstone [everyone]
* Setup Allen Dai's project and read their source code [everyone]
* Decide on a tech stack to start with [everyone]
* Get in contact with Allen Dai over email to establish contact and ask for
  resources, ideas, as well as getting an image set to work with [Nick]
