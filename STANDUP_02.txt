STANDUP 02 - 2/13/2023 Team Axolotl


General Update
==============

Since Friday, we have continued to look into Allen Dai's source code, both the
working version and his attempted modifications. This, along with the 
documentation gave us a better idea of what exactly we needed to do. We decided
to use the same technology Allen did, but build a more organized architecture.


Requirements
============

* Convert Allen's pixel measurements to real-world units
* Use colored dots to mark where measurements begin and end
* Allow for annotation
* Implement coordinates within the image viewer
* Store measurements in local storage
* Allow resetting of measurements both in a single photo and for an entire set
  of scans


Questions / Problems / What We Need
===================================

* We need a data source (image sets)
* We need to develop an organized architecture before we start building


Tasks / Working Packages
========================

* Get access to a set of images via Allen or McCusker lab [Nick] soon as 
  possible
* Copy the working versions of index.html and viewer.html into our repository
  to use as a starting point [everyone] by Friday 2/17
* Come up with an organizational plan for the architecture to easily add 
  features [everyone] by Friday 2/17
* Divide requirements into indivual tasks, assign them, and use Github issues 
  to track them [everyone] by Friday 2/17

Done
====

* Everyone has read documentation and source code [2/13/23]
* Decision made on tech stack, we won't add anything new at this point 
  [2/10/23]
* Allen has been emailed with group members CC'd, awaiting response [2/10/23]
